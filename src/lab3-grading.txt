Found Issues:
- upper caps for variables other than constants, line 30-31
- code not seperated into short and consise methods (only one other method than main())
Comments:
- move code of lab3 in seperate package, e.g. "sheet3"
- why keep the motors public?
- shorten main method
- if-else-block (line 45-46) not placed correctly
Points:
